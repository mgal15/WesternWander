# WesternWander
Welcome to the Western Wander! This is a interactive scavenger hunt across the Western Washington University's campus. I made this for a final project for a web design class at WWU. The purpose of the project is to help new students discover what helpful resources and cool places live inside different buildings. There is a point system to make this feel more game-like, and hints take away points as well.

This was made with the help of bootstrap to make the mobile site more accessible. As well as vanilla javascript and HTML and CSS as well.
